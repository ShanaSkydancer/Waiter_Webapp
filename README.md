## About app
***
The Waiter Webapp is perfect system for waiters and admin alike. Waiters log in and submit the days that they're working for the week. The admin can log in and access the waiters and which days they're working, and also rest the week's data to start again new for the waiters to submit their days.

## How to use the app
***

The application is live on heroku here:
`https://codex-waiter-webapp.herokuapp.com/`

1. A user logs in as a waiter.
	* (Logging in as a waiter will take you to the waiter page, alternatevly, logging in as an admin will take you to an admin.)
	* Enter a username and password and click 'log in'.

2. Select the days that you'd like to work and click 'submit'.
	* As a waiter your job is done.

3. Log in as admin with the username "Admin" or "admin" and click 'log in'.
	* Now as an admin you want to access the days your staff is working.

4. As an admin you will not be taken to a screen to select days but rather an admin screen where you can view a table of week days and waiters working in those days.
	* The tables cell will turn red if there is more than 3 waiters working a day.
	* Green if there is just 3 waiters working (the perfect amount).
	* Stay white if there is less than 3 waiters working.
	* As an admin you can press the 'reset' button and remove all waiters working for that week, so that the waiters can submit new working days for the next week.
